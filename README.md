# Treasure Trap Proposal

## Object of the Game

The player will be trapped in a treasure room and be prompted that the pirate that stored his treasure here will let
them leave with the treasure if they survive his game. Projectiles from the walls will shoot from all directions. Obstacles will drop and hurt the player if they land on them. After each round, projectiles and obstacles will move faster and render more frequent. If they survive a round, a treasure will drop.

## MVPs
